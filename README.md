# Yockers X-Ray for Minecraft Bedrock

My version of the Xray for mcpe works with the block shapes in the blockshapes part. There you will find all possible blockshapes of bedrock version 1.14! In my pack I used the green marked block shapes so I can see where blocks are otherwise I would have used the unsafe block shape.

## Usage

Download these files as ".zip" file and rename them to a ".mcpack" renaming [tutorial](https://youtu.be/eaeVxQUnWoY). On Compuers you can find the pack under the following file path:

*note: replace the XXX with the username of your windows account*
```
C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\resource_packs
```
then open the pack with the name "yockers x-ray" or a short form of it. then open the blocks.json file and oritate to the next section.

## How to edit the Pack

You have to edit them in the blocks.json if you want to have for example transparent stone, sandstone, gravel, dirt etc blocks you have to enter for example invisible at the blockshape field in this file.

**Green:** is the name of the texture you want to change

**Blue:** [replace options](#Blockshapes)
